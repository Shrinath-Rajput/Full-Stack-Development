Kohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup
Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[169][170] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat.[171] He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[172][173] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[174][175] Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[14] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[176] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[177] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[178]

However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[179] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[180] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[181][182] Former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[183]

Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batter by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[184][185] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[186] He has amassed 28 of his 51 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[187] and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[188] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[189] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[190][191]

Aggression
Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[192][193] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.[194] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[195][196] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[197][198] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[199] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[200] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[201] In contrast, former India captain Kapil Dev suggested Kohli's aggression was fake, saying Rohit Sharma "doesn’t show fake aggression like Kohli."[202]

Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar
Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[203][204] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[205] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented.[206] Nevertheless, Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has notes that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots.[207]

In a discourse with Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[208] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.[209]

In 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills and attitude and saw great potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment.[210] Over the years, Kohli's brand endorsement portfolio has experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ₹100 crore (US$12 million).[211] Now in 2023, his brand value has reached ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million).[212] His bat deal with MRF is regarded as one of the most financially rewarding deals in cricket history.[213] In 2017, Kohli entered into a notable endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ₹1.1 billion (US$13 million). This deal made Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract valued at ₹100 crore (US$12 million) deal with a brand.[214] As of January 2023, Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at ₹165 crore (US$20 million).[215] Kohli is currently recognized as the most followed Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram, boasting over 274 million followers on the platform. Reports indicate that he is able to command a fee of ₹8.9 crore (equivalent to ₹9.4 crore or US$1.1 million in 2023) for each sponsored post on the platform.[216]
